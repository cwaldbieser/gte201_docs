Introduction

The TIER Access Governance (201) builds on Grouper Basics and explores 
the access governance approach described in the `Grouper Deployment Guide`_.
After completing Grouper 201, the student will have an understanding of how
use Grouper primitives to achieve access governance capabilities, and be able
to translate natural language policy into digital policy.

Conventions
-----------

In the documentation, references will be made to Grouper groups and
folders (stems).  These references will sometimes take the form of a complete
path to the referenced object, such as `app:vpn:ref:ad_hoc`.  Other times,
the references will be relative to the current context under discussion.
For example, when referring to the same application-specific reference group
for the VPN service, the notation `...:ref:ad_hoc` may be used to indicate that
a portion of the full path has been omitted.
